forensic analysis of RasPi used in Hackathon
used for development and have been attacked while in production
2-3 page paper, code, and 8 min presentation

Analyze
-installed software
-custom software
  -code analysis on it
  -run it in VM to determine weaknesses, possible attack vectors
-other system info
-basic system info
  -OS
  -listeners
  -iptables
  -users
-forensics script
  -visualization
-evidence handling sheet

/var/log
bash history

hackathon goal was games, attacking eachother

OS: cat /mnt/etc/os-release

DNS servers: cat /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
log messages: cat/mnt/var/log/*
commands: cat /mnt/home/pi/.bash_history
What was their code supposed to do?
server, look at python_games
What weaknesses are in their code?

Create a python script: 
 - automount the drive as read only and hash everything 
 - create a table with users and times
 - create a timeline of system events looking at /var/log/*
 - create a timeline of file changes
 - visualize IP addresses

report:
 - vulnerabilities
 - user accounts: last -f /mnt/var/log/wtmp, cat /mnt/etc/passwd, jack the ripper
 - firewall: look through iptables commands
 - application purpose, look through /home/pi/server files
 - time of changes, start from feb 10, 
 - time of attack
 - evidence handling sheet

software installed:
look at bash_history and /home/pi/
